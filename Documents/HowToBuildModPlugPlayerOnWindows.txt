This document was prepared for Windows MSYS2 environment

Replace <environment> keyword with your choice of MSYS2 environment on this document, such as x86_64, ucrt-x86_64, clang-x86_64, clang-aarch64

If you want to compile ModPlug Player for ARM64 Windows platform, replace <environment> keyword with clang-aarch64

-> Download and install MSYS2 from https://www.msys2.org

-> Run MSYS2 MSYS

-> Update your MSYS2 environment according to https://www.msys2.org/docs/updating
pacman -Suy

-> If MSYS2 terminal is closed, run MSYS2 MSYS environment again, and until you see everything is up to date, run the command below repeatedly.
pacman -Suy

-> Install the required dependencies.
pacman -S --needed \
    base-devel \
    msys2-runtime \
    p7zip \
    cmake \
    git \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-cmake \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-toolchain \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-qt6 \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-cmake \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-ninja \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-portaudio \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-libopenmpt \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-boost \
    mingw-w64-<environment>-fftw

-> You can close your MSYS2 MSYS window now (the one with purple icon)

-> Start your choice of MSYS2 environment, such as MSYS2 CLANGARM64

-> Change your working directory to your home folder
cd ~

->Clone latest tagged version of Modplug Player (Alpha3 as example)
git clone --branch Alpha3 --recurse-submodules https://github.com/ModPlugPlayer/ModPlugPlayer.git ModPlugPlayer
->or
git clone  --branch Alpha3 --recurse-submodules https://git.code.sf.net/p/modplugplayer/ModPlugPlayer ModPlugPlayer

->Create ModPlug Player build directory in your home folder
mkdir ~/MPPBinary

-> Change working directory with ModPlugPlayer directory
cd ~/ModPlugPlayer

-> Configure ModPlug Player with CMake
cmake -B ~/MPPBinary -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release

-> Build ModPlug Player
cd ~/MPPBinary
cmake --build ~/MPPBinary --config Release

-> Now you can find ModPlug Player executable binary file under ~/MPPBinary folder. If you want to see the compiled exe file, you can use the command below.
explorer .

-> If you double click ModPlug Player.exe file, it will not work, because it needs Qt distribution and other libraries' dll files. You can run ModPlug Player from your selected MSYS2 environment terminal such as MSYS2 CLANGARM64.
~/MPPBinary/ModPlug\ Player.exe

-> If you want to make a distribution containing all the needed dll files, you can compile and use source code in ModPlugPlayer/DeploymentScripts/DeployOnMSYS2.cpp file.
